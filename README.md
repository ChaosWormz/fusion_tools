# fusion_tools
The fusion tools mod from Bananaland

The mod adds fused tools, this combines  the trusty axe, pickaxe, and shovel into one super powerful force of minetest, awe and splendour. Bask in it's radiant glory as you moral won't have to ever switch tools again while minning those -wimpy- nodes. Hear the cave parsing your name in the full spectrum of all bathing effulgent glamour.

Make the nodes feel like they are birds whom have no greater desire then to flock and migrate over into your inventory (or into the chest of purgatory if they are not worthy to bask in your light)

Oh and something about 3 tier...
